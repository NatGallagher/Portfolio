                <p>Hi, I’m Nat Gallagher — a certified software engineer with a passion for building practical, user-focused web applications. I earned my certification through QuickStart, in partnership with The University of Tennessee, and specialize in full stack web development.

I’m proficient in a range of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and SQL. I thrive in problem-solving environments and enjoy collaborating to create clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.

Before transitioning into tech, I was a teacher—an experience that sharpened my communication, collaboration, and leadership skills. That background gives me a unique edge as a developer who values clarity, teamwork, and continuous growth.

I’m currently seeking opportunities as a Full Stack Developer, Front-End or Back-End Developer, or JavaScript Developer. I’m open to work and excited to contribute to a mission-driven team.</p>
