                <a href="https://natgallagher.github.io/Gallagh-Project-1/">Business Website</a>
                <p>This is a clean, responsive website designed to promote the services of a freelance music arranger. Built primarily with HTML and CSS, it features an embedded audio sample player and a contact form, making it easy for potential clients to preview work and get in touch directly. This project demonstrates how creatives and small business owners can establish a professional online presence to showcase their skills and attract new opportunities.</p>

                <p>A fun and interactive web app that lets users search for and browse animated GIFs to share with friends! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates how to retrieve data from an external API, fetch and process that data, and dynamically display the results in an engaging format. It’s a great example of working with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript in a real-world application.

                <a href="https://natgallagher.github.io/Gallagh-Project-3/">Task Manager App</a>
                <p>This is a fully functional to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, mark tasks as complete, and filter tasks based on their status (all, active, or completed). Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, the app offers a clean and responsive user interface for managing daily tasks efficiently.

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. It allows developers to build reusable components and manage application state effectively, making it easier to create fast, dynamic, and scalable web apps. In this project, React handles user interactions and dynamically updates the UI as tasks are added or changed—without reloading the page.</p>

                <a href="https://natgallagher.github.io/Gallagh-Project-4/">Bible Verse Memory App</a>
                <p>This is a full-stack web application designed to help users memorize and manage Bible verses. The app follows a 3-tier architecture consisting of:<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Frontend (User Interface): What the user sees and interacts with</li>
                    <li>Backend (APIs): Handles requests and responses</li>
                    <li>Database (SQLite): Stores user credentials and, eventually, personalized memory verses</li>
                </ul>

Built with React, Node.js, Express, and SQLite, the app allows users to register with a unique username and password, securely log in, and begin working with preloaded memory verses. Logged-in users can select a verse to focus on by clicking the associated button.<br/>

While the app is still in development, its core functionality is live and user-friendly. Upcoming features include the ability for users to save and organize their own memory verses, providing a personalized experience for Scripture memorization.</p>
